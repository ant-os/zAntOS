[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Inspects, updates and manages submodules.

       For more information about submodules, see [1mgitsubmodules[22m(7).

[1mCOMMANDS[0m
       With no arguments, shows the status of existing submodules. Several subcommands
       are available to perform operations on the submodules.

       add [-b <branch>] [-f|--force] [--name <name>] [--reference <repository>]
       [--ref-format <format>] [--depth <depth>] [--] <repository> [<path>]
           Add the given repository as a submodule at the given path to the changeset to
           be committed next to the current project: the current project is termed the
           "superproject".

           <repository> is the URL of the new submodule’s origin repository. This may be
           either an absolute URL, or (if it begins with ./ or ../), the location
           relative to the superproject’s default remote repository (Please note that to
           specify a repository [4mfoo.git[24m which is located right next to a superproject
           [4mbar.git[24m, you’ll have to use [1m../foo.git [22minstead of [1m./foo.git [22m- as one might
           expect when following the rules for relative URLs - because the evaluation of
           relative URLs in Git is identical to that of relative directories).

           The default remote is the remote of the remote-tracking branch of the current
           branch. If no such remote-tracking branch exists or the HEAD is detached,
           "origin" is assumed to be the default remote. If the superproject doesn’t have
           a default remote configured the superproject is its own authoritative upstream
           and the current working directory is used instead.

           The optional argument <path> is the relative location for the cloned submodule
           to exist in the superproject. If <path> is not given, the canonical part of
           the source repository is used ("repo" for "/path/to/repo.git" and "foo" for
           "host.xz:foo/.git"). If <path> exists and is already a valid Git repository,
           then it is staged for commit without cloning. The <path> is also used as the
           submodule’s logical name in its configuration entries unless [1m--name [22mis used to
           specify a logical name.

           The given URL is recorded into [1m.gitmodules [22mfor use by subsequent users cloning
           the superproject. If the URL is given relative to the superproject’s
           repository, the presumption is the superproject and submodule repositories
           will be kept together in the same relative location, and only the
           superproject’s URL needs to be provided. git-submodule will correctly locate
           the submodule using the relative URL in [1m.gitmodules[22m.

           If [1m--ref-format [4m[22m<format>[24m is specified, the ref storage format of newly cloned
           submodules will be set accordingly.

       status [--cached] [--recursive] [--] [<path>...]
           Show the status of the submodules. This will print the SHA-1 of the currently
           checked out commit for each submodule, along with the submodule path and the
           output of [4mgit[24m [4mdescribe[24m for the SHA-1. Each SHA-1 will possibly be prefixed
           with [1m- [22mif the submodule is not initialized, [1m+ [22mif the currently checked out
           submodule commit does not match the SHA-1 found in the index of the containing
           repository and [1mU [22mif the submodule has merge conflicts.

           If [1m--cached [22mis specified, this command will instead print the SHA-1 recorded
           in the superproject for each submodule.

           If [1m--recursive [22mis specified, this command will recurse into nested submodules,
           and show their status as well.

           If you are only interested in changes of the currently initialized submodules
           with respect to the commit recorded in the index or the HEAD, [1mgit-status[22m(1)
           and [1mgit-diff[22m(1) will provide that information too (and can also report changes
           to a submodule’s work tree).

       init [--] [<path>...]
           Initialize the submodules recorded in the index (which were added and
           committed elsewhere) by setting [1msubmodule.$name.url [22min [1m.git/config[22m, using the
           same setting from [1m.gitmodules [22mas a template. If the URL is relative, it will
           be resolved using the default remote. If there is no default remote, the
           current repository will be assumed to be upstream.

           Optional <path> arguments limit which submodules will be initialized. If no
           path is specified and submodule.active has been configured, submodules
           configured to be active will be initialized, otherwise all submodules are
           initialized.

           It will also copy the value of [1msubmodule.$name.update[22m, if present in the
           [1m.gitmodules [22mfile, to [1m.git/config[22m, but (1) this command does not alter existing
           information in [1m.git/config[22m, and (2) [1msubmodule.$name.update [22mthat is set to a
           custom command is [1mnot [22mcopied for security reasons.

           You can then customize the submodule clone URLs in [1m.git/config [22mfor your local
           setup and proceed to [1mgit submodule update[22m; you can also just use [1mgit submodule[0m
           [1mupdate --init [22mwithout the explicit [4minit[24m step if you do not intend to customize
           any submodule locations.

           See the add subcommand for the definition of default remote.

       deinit [-f|--force] (--all|[--] <path>...)
           Unregister the given submodules, i.e. remove the whole [1msubmodule.$name [22msection
           from .git/config together with their work tree. Further calls to [1mgit submodule[0m
           [1mupdate[22m, [1mgit submodule foreach [22mand [1mgit submodule sync [22mwill skip any
           unregistered submodules until they are initialized again, so use this command
           if you don’t want to have a local checkout of the submodule in your working
           tree anymore.

           When the command is run without pathspec, it errors out, instead of deinit-ing
           everything, to prevent mistakes.

           If [1m--force [22mis specified, the submodule’s working tree will be removed even if
           it contains local modifications.

           If you really want to remove a submodule from the repository and commit that
           use [1mgit-rm[22m(1) instead. See [1mgitsubmodules[22m(7) for removal options.

       update [--init] [--remote] [-N|--no-fetch] [--[no-]recommend-shallow] [-f|--force]
       [--checkout|--rebase|--merge] [--reference <repository>] [--ref-format <format>]
       [--depth <depth>] [--recursive] [--jobs <n>] [--[no-]single-branch] [--filter
       <filter-spec>] [--] [<path>...]
           Update the registered submodules to match what the superproject expects by
           cloning missing submodules, fetching missing commits in submodules and
           updating the working tree of the submodules. The "updating" can be done in
           several ways depending on command line options and the value of
           [1msubmodule.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.update [22mconfiguration variable. The command line option takes
           precedence over the configuration variable. If neither is given, a [4mcheckout[24m is
           performed. (note: what is in [1m.gitmodules [22mfile is irrelevant at this point; see
           [1mgit submodule init [22mabove for how [1m.gitmodules [22mis used). The [4mupdate[24m procedures
           supported both from the command line as well as through the
           [1msubmodule.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.update [22mconfiguration are:

           checkout
               the commit recorded in the superproject will be checked out in the
               submodule on a detached HEAD.

               If [1m--force [22mis specified, the submodule will be checked out (using [1mgit[0m
               [1mcheckout --force[22m), even if the commit specified in the index of the
               containing repository already matches the commit checked out in the
               submodule.

           rebase
               the current branch of the submodule will be rebased onto the commit
               recorded in the superproject.

           merge
               the commit recorded in the superproject will be merged into the current
               branch in the submodule.

           The following update procedures have additional limitations:

           custom command
               mechanism for running arbitrary commands with the commit ID as an
               argument. Specifically, if the [1msubmodule.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.update [22mconfiguration
               variable is set to !custom [1mcommand[22m, the object name of the commit recorded
               in the superproject for the submodule is appended to the [1mcustom command[0m
               string and executed. Note that this mechanism is not supported in the
               [1m.gitmodules [22mfile or on the command line.

           none
               the submodule is not updated. This update procedure is not allowed on the
               command line.

           If the submodule is not yet initialized, and you just want to use the setting
           as stored in [1m.gitmodules[22m, you can automatically initialize the submodule with
           the [1m--init [22moption.

           If [1m--recursive [22mis specified, this command will recurse into the registered
           submodules, and update any nested submodules within.

           If [1m--ref-format [4m[22m<format>[24m is specified, the ref storage format of newly cloned
           submodules will be set accordingly.

           If [1m--filter [4m[22m<filter-spec>[24m is specified, the given partial clone filter will be
           applied to the submodule. See [1mgit-rev-list[22m(1) for details on filter
           specifications.

       set-branch (-b|--branch) <branch> [--] <path>, set-branch (-d|--default) [--]
       <path>
           Sets the default remote tracking branch for the submodule. The [1m--branch [22moption
           allows the remote branch to be specified. The [1m--default [22moption removes the
           submodule.<name>.branch configuration key, which causes the tracking branch to
           default to the remote [4mHEAD[24m.

       set-url [--] <path> <newurl>
           Sets the URL of the specified submodule to <newurl>. Then, it will
           automatically synchronize the submodule’s new remote URL configuration.

       summary [--cached|--files] [(-n|--summary-limit) <n>] [commit] [--] [<path>...]
           Show commit summary between the given commit (defaults to HEAD) and working
           tree/index. For a submodule in question, a series of commits in the submodule
           between the given super project commit and the index or working tree (switched
           by [1m--cached[22m) are shown. If the option [1m--files [22mis given, show the series of
           commits in the submodule between the index of the super project and the
           working tree of the submodule (this option doesn’t allow to use the [1m--cached[0m
           option or to provide an explicit commit).

           Using the [1m--submodule=log [22moption with [1mgit-diff[22m(1) will provide that
           information too.

       foreach [--recursive] <command>
           Evaluates an arbitrary shell command in each checked out submodule. The
           command has access to the variables $name, $sm_path, $displaypath, $sha1 and
           $toplevel: $name is the name of the relevant submodule section in [1m.gitmodules[22m,
           $sm_path is the path of the submodule as recorded in the immediate
           superproject, $displaypath contains the relative path from the current working
           directory to the submodules root directory, $sha1 is the commit as recorded in
           the immediate superproject, and $toplevel is the absolute path to the
           top-level of the immediate superproject. Note that to avoid conflicts with
           [4m$PATH[24m on Windows, the [4m$path[24m variable is now a deprecated synonym of [4m$sm_path[0m
           variable. Any submodules defined in the superproject but not checked out are
           ignored by this command. Unless given [1m--quiet[22m, foreach prints the name of each
           submodule before evaluating the command. If [1m--recursive [22mis given, submodules
           are traversed recursively (i.e. the given shell command is evaluated in nested
           submodules as well). A non-zero return from the command in any submodule
           causes the processing to terminate. This can be overridden by adding [4m||[24m [4m:[24m to
           the end of the command.

           As an example, the command below will show the path and currently checked out
           commit for each submodule:

               git submodule foreach 'echo $sm_path ‘git rev-parse HEAD‘'

       sync [--recursive] [--] [<path>...]
           Synchronizes submodules' remote URL configuration setting to the value
           specified in [1m.gitmodules[22m. It will only affect those submodules which already
           have a URL entry in .git/config (that is the case when they are initialized or
           freshly added). This is useful when submodule URLs change upstream and you
           need to update your local repositories accordingly.

           [1mgit submodule sync [22msynchronizes all submodules while [1mgit submodule sync -- A[0m
           synchronizes submodule "A" only.

           If [1m--recursive [22mis specified, this command will recurse into the registered
           submodules, and sync any nested submodules within.

       absorbgitdirs
           If a git directory of a submodule is inside the submodule, move the git
           directory of the submodule into its superproject’s [1m$GIT_DIR/modules [22mpath and
           then connect the git directory and its working directory by setting the
           [1mcore.worktree [22mand adding a .git file pointing to the git directory embedded in
           the superprojects git directory.

           A repository that was cloned independently and later added as a submodule or
           old setups have the submodules git directory inside the submodule instead of
           embedded into the superprojects git directory.

           This command is recursive by default.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       -q, --quiet
           Only print error messages.

       --progress
           This option is only valid for add and update commands. Progress status is
           reported on the standard error stream by default when it is attached to a
           terminal, unless -q is specified. This flag forces progress status even if the
           standard error stream is not directed to a terminal.

       --all
           This option is only valid for the deinit command. Unregister all submodules in
           the working tree.

       -b <branch>, --branch <branch>
           Branch of repository to add as submodule. The name of the branch is recorded
           as [1msubmodule.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.branch [22min [1m.gitmodules [22mfor [1mupdate --remote[22m. A special value
           of . is used to indicate that the name of the branch in the submodule should
           be the same name as the current branch in the current repository. If the
           option is not specified, it defaults to the remote [4mHEAD[24m.

       -f, --force
           This option is only valid for add, deinit and update commands. When running
           add, allow adding an otherwise ignored submodule path. This option is also
           used to bypass a check that the submodule’s name is not already in use. By
           default, [4mgit[24m [4msubmodule[24m [4madd[24m will fail if the proposed name (which is derived
           from the path) is already registered for another submodule in the repository.
           Using [4m--force[24m allows the command to proceed by automatically generating a
           unique name by appending a number to the conflicting name (e.g., if a
           submodule named [4mchild[24m exists, it will try [4mchild1[24m, and so on). When running
           deinit the submodule working trees will be removed even if they contain local
           changes. When running update (only effective with the checkout procedure),
           throw away local changes in submodules when switching to a different commit;
           and always run a checkout operation in the submodule, even if the commit
           listed in the index of the containing repository matches the commit checked
           out in the submodule.

       --cached
           This option is only valid for status and summary commands. These commands
           typically use the commit found in the submodule HEAD, but with this option,
           the commit stored in the index is used instead.

       --files
           This option is only valid for the summary command. This command compares the
           commit in the index with that in the submodule HEAD when this option is used.

       -n, --summary-limit
           This option is only valid for the summary command. Limit the summary size
           (number of commits shown in total). Giving 0 will disable the summary; a
           negative number means unlimited (the default). This limit only applies to
           modified submodules. The size is always limited to 1 for
           added/deleted/typechanged submodules.

       --remote
           This option is only valid for the update command. Instead of using the
           superproject’s recorded SHA-1 to update the submodule, use the status of the
           submodule’s remote-tracking branch. The remote used is branch’s remote
           ([1mbranch.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.remote[22m), defaulting to [1morigin[22m. The remote branch used defaults
           to the remote [1mHEAD[22m, but the branch name may be overridden by setting the
           [1msubmodule.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.branch [22moption in either [1m.gitmodules [22mor [1m.git/config [22m(with
           [1m.git/config [22mtaking precedence).

           This works for any of the supported update procedures ([1m--checkout[22m, [1m--rebase[22m,
           etc.). The only change is the source of the target SHA-1. For example,
           [1msubmodule update --remote --merge [22mwill merge upstream submodule changes into
           the submodules, while [1msubmodule update --merge [22mwill merge superproject gitlink
           changes into the submodules.

           In order to ensure a current tracking branch state, [1mupdate --remote [22mfetches
           the submodule’s remote repository before calculating the SHA-1. If you don’t
           want to fetch, you should use [1msubmodule update --remote --no-fetch[22m.

           Use this option to integrate changes from the upstream subproject with your
           submodule’s current HEAD. Alternatively, you can run [1mgit pull [22mfrom the
           submodule, which is equivalent except for the remote branch name: [1mupdate[0m
           [1m--remote [22muses the default upstream repository and [1msubmodule.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.branch[22m,
           while [1mgit pull [22muses the submodule’s [1mbranch.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.merge[22m. Prefer
           [1msubmodule.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.branch [22mif you want to distribute the default upstream branch
           with the superproject and [1mbranch.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.merge [22mif you want a more native feel
           while working in the submodule itself.

       -N, --no-fetch
           This option is only valid for the update command. Don’t fetch new objects from
           the remote site.

       --checkout
           This option is only valid for the update command. Checkout the commit recorded
           in the superproject on a detached HEAD in the submodule. This is the default
           behavior, the main use of this option is to override [1msubmodule.$name.update[0m
           when set to a value other than [1mcheckout[22m. If the key [1msubmodule.$name.update [22mis
           either not explicitly set or set to [1mcheckout[22m, this option is implicit.

       --merge
           This option is only valid for the update command. Merge the commit recorded in
           the superproject into the current branch of the submodule. If this option is
           given, the submodule’s HEAD will not be detached. If a merge failure prevents
           this process, you will have to resolve the resulting conflicts within the
           submodule with the usual conflict resolution tools. If the key
           [1msubmodule.$name.update [22mis set to [1mmerge[22m, this option is implicit.

       --rebase
           This option is only valid for the update command. Rebase the current branch
           onto the commit recorded in the superproject. If this option is given, the
           submodule’s HEAD will not be detached. If a merge failure prevents this
           process, you will have to resolve these failures with [1mgit-rebase[22m(1). If the
           key [1msubmodule.$name.update [22mis set to [1mrebase[22m, this option is implicit.

       --init
           This option is only valid for the update command. Initialize all submodules
           for which "git submodule init" has not been called so far before updating.

       --name
           This option is only valid for the add command. It sets the submodule’s name to
           the given string instead of defaulting to its path. The name must be valid as
           a directory name and may not end with a [4m/[24m.

       --reference <repository>
           This option is only valid for add and update commands. These commands
           sometimes need to clone a remote repository. In this case, this option will be
           passed to the [1mgit-clone[22m(1) command.

           [1mNOTE[22m: Do [1mnot [22muse this option unless you have read the note for [1mgit-clone[22m(1)'s
           [1m--reference[22m, [1m--shared[22m, and [1m--dissociate [22moptions carefully.

       --dissociate
           This option is only valid for add and update commands. These commands
           sometimes need to clone a remote repository. In this case, this option will be
           passed to the [1mgit-clone[22m(1) command.

           [1mNOTE[22m: see the NOTE for the [1m--reference [22moption.

       --recursive
           This option is only valid for foreach, update, status and sync commands.
           Traverse submodules recursively. The operation is performed not only in the
           submodules of the current repo, but also in any nested submodules inside those
           submodules (and so on).

       --depth
           This option is valid for add and update commands. Create a [4mshallow[24m clone with
           a history truncated to the specified number of revisions. See [1mgit-clone[22m(1)

       --[no-]recommend-shallow
           This option is only valid for the update command. The initial clone of a
           submodule will use the recommended [1msubmodule.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.shallow [22mas provided by the
           [1m.gitmodules [22mfile by default. To ignore the suggestions use
           [1m--no-recommend-shallow[22m.

       -j <n>, --jobs <n>
           This option is only valid for the update command. Clone new submodules in
           parallel with as many jobs. Defaults to the [1msubmodule.fetchJobs [22moption.

       --[no-]single-branch
           This option is only valid for the update command. Clone only one branch during
           update: HEAD or one specified by --branch.

       <path>...
           Paths to submodule(s). When specified this will restrict the command to only
           operate on the submodules found at the specified paths. (This argument is
           required with add).

[1mFILES[0m
       When initializing submodules, a [1m.gitmodules [22mfile in the top-level directory of the
       containing repository is used to find the url of each submodule. This file should
       be formatted in the same way as [1m$GIT_DIR/config[22m. The key to each submodule url is
       "submodule.$name.url". See [1mgitmodules[22m(5) for details.
